            <p>In recent years, I've embarked on a self-taught coding journey, and six months ago, I took a significant step forward by enrolling in an accelerated coding bootcamp focused on full-stack web development. The decision to dive into this field fills me with pride and happinessâ€”I've found my passion.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, I'm excited about the array of apps and video games I have brewing in my mind. Now armed with a solid foundation in coding, I'm eager to turn these ideas into reality and bring them to life</p>
